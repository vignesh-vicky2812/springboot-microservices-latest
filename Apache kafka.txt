kafka broker acts as a message broker between producer and consumer
each kafka broker has list of topics.
each kafka cluster should have atleast three kafka brokers
topics is like a table in a database	
topics can be divided into partitions (and an offset is a unique identifier for a specific message within a partition of a topic.each message in the partition is assigned a sequential and unique offset, starting from 0)
zookeeper will take care of the kafka brokers in the cluster

.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties (start zookeeper service)
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties (start kafka broker service on windows)
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic topic-example --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 (create kafka topic to store your events)
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --topic topic-example --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 (write some events into the topic)
>hello
>world


.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic topic-example --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 (read the events)
