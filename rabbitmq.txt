rabbitmq is one of the simplest freely available options for implementing messaging queues

producer - exchange - queue - consumer

exchange acts as a intermediate between producer and queue(can have multiple queues also)
exchange will route the message to the different queues.

routing key decides how to route the message to queues. the routing key is like an address for the message 

binding is a link between queue and exchange
